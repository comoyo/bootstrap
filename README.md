# Comoyo Bootstrap

This is a simple fork of [Twitter Bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) to simplify updating of the Bootstrap framework, and potentially provide a simple Comoyofied version of the bootstrap project for simple prototyping of web applications.

The project is currently maintained for use with [Browsee](https://github.com/comoyo/browsee), the browser client for SMS+.
